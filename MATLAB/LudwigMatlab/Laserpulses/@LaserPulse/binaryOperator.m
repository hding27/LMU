function res = binaryOperator(pulse1, pulse2, op, activeDomain)
% BINARYOPERATOR applies a binary operator to two LaserPulse objects.
%
% EXAMPLE:
% p = binaryOperator(p1, p2, @func, 'frequency')
%  calculates p == amp*exp(1i*phase) in frequency domain
%  from p1 == a1(f)*exp(1i*phi1(f)) and p2 == a2(f)*exp(1i*phi2(f))
%  using [amp,phase] = func(a1,phi1,a2,phi2).
%
% INPUTS:
%   pulse1: instance of LaserPulse
%   pulse2: instance of LaserPulse
%   op: handle to a function [amp,phase]=f(amp1,phase1,amp2,phase2)
%   activeDomain (optional): domain in which the binary operator is
%     applied. If not specified the domain specified by the property
%     'updatedDomain_' is used. If both domains are currently updated
%     (updatedDomain_=='all'), the time domain is used.
%
% OUTPUTS:
%   p: the output pulse
%
% If not specified otherwise, the operator is applied on the active domain
% of the first pulse.
