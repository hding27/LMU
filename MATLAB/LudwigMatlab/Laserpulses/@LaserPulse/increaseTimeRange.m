function increaseTimeRange(pulse, newrange, units)
% INCREASETIMERANGE increases the time range of the pulse.
% It increases the number of time steps while keeping timeStep constant,
% zhen it interpolates over the frequency domain.
%
% USAGE:
% for setting a new range of (deltaT) femtoseconds
% pulse.increaseTimeRange(deltaT)
% pulse.increaseTimeRange(deltaT ,'fs')
%
% for setting a range of n times the pulse duration (fwhm)
% pulse.increaseTimeRange(deltaT, 'fwhm'); 
%
% for setting a range of n standard deviations
% pulse.increaseTimeRange(n, 'std')

%% IMPLEMENTATION DETAILS:
%  increasing time range by interpolating over the frequency domain is
%  better than doing so by padding time domain arrays with zeros, because
%  in the second case the temporal field is not changed.
