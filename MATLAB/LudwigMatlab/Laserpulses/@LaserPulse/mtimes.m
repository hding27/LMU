function res = mtimes(pulse1, pulse2)
% MTIMES multiplies two pulses in the active domain of the first pulse.
% It is equivalent to convolution in the reciprocal domain.
%
% In this implementation mtimes is the same as times.
%
% INPUTS:
%   pulse1: instance of LaserPulse
%   pulse2: instance of LaserPulse
%
% OUTPUTS:
%   p: the multiplied pulse
%
% If the two pulses have different sampling , they are interpolated over a
% commond domain.
