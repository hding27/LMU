function increaseNumberFreqSteps(pulse, nPoints)
% INCREASENUMBERFREQSTEPS increases nPoints keeping frequencyStep fixed
%
% Setting nPoints manually can affect either the frequencyStep or the
% timeStep, depending on which of the two is defined in function of the
% other.
% The increaseNumberFreqSteps function provides a reliable way to set
% nPoints while keeping frequencyStep fixed (timeStep will be adjusted
% accordingly behind the scenes)
